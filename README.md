# BoxCrittersCompanion
A Python Script that Automatically Boots Up Box Critters &amp; Has Discord Rich Presence

**WIP**

## Use
To use BCC, edit the Python script and replace the lines "ENTER YOUR BOX CRITTERS EMAIL HERE" and "ENTER YOUR BOX CRITTERS PASSWORD HERE" with your email and password respectively. After that, you can run the script and enter your Operating System (Currently the only supported OS is Windows) and your Browser (The only one I've tested that works is Chrome) or you can type "$" to use windows & chrome immediately.

## Plans
Hopefully, in the future, BCC will be able to:
* Automatically add scripts into the game, like tampermonkey
* Add, Save and Use Logins
